Write an object prototype for a Person that has a name and age, has a
printInfo method, and also has a method that 
increments the persons age by 1 each time the method is called.
Create two people using the 'new' keyword, and print 
both of their infos and increment one persons
age by 3 years. Use an arrow function for both methods
